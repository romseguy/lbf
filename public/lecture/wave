[5829] About knowledge and awareness: the two words are similar but are not of the degree of intensity. For example, I could have awareness of aliens, but not "direct" knowledge. I could be aware of physics but not have knowledge of physics. If I have knowledge, I have awareness. However, one could have awareness, but not knowledge. Many of us -once we are aware- stop our quest for knowledge because we think we know and that is all that is necessary.
